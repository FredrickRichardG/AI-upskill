Design a microservices architecture for a learning
management system:
Services:
- User Service (students, instructors, admins)
- Course Service (course content, modules, lessons)
- Enrollment Service (student enrollments, progress tracking)
- Assessment Service (quizzes, assignments, grading)
- Notification Service (emails, push notifications)
Technical Stack:
- Spring Boot 3 with Spring WebFlux
- PostgreSQL with Spring Data JPA
- Redis for caching and sessions
- RabbitMQ for async messaging
- Spring Cloud Gateway for API routing
- Docker and Kubernetes deployment
Generate:
1. Service decomposition strategy
User Service

Handles: Students, instructors, admins

Responsibilities: Registration, role management, authentication

Notes: Central identity source; integrate with Spring Authorization Server or Keycloak

Course Service

Handles: Courses, modules, lessons

Responsibilities: Manage course content, outline, authoring

Notes: Publishes course lifecycle events

Enrollment Service

Handles: Course enrollments and progress tracking

Responsibilities: Enroll users, track lesson completion, compute progress

Notes: Uses CourseService events to track course availability

Assessment Service

Handles: Quizzes, assignments, grading

Responsibilities: Manage question banks, accept submissions, auto/manual grading

Notes: Emits grade-related events to downstream consumers

Notification Service

Handles: Email, push notifications

Responsibilities: Fan-out events from other services, user-preference based comms

Notes: Highly asynchronous, uses deduplication via Redis

Spring Cloud Gateway

API gateway for routing, auth, rate-limiting

Validates JWTs and propagates identity headers

Central enforcement point for security and throttling

Hereâ€™s a **service decomposition strategy** for your Learning Management System (LMS) microservices architecture, tailored to your technical stack and requirements:

---

## 1. Service Decomposition Strategy

### **A. User Service**
- **Domain:** Students, Instructors, Admins
- **Responsibilities:**
  - User registration and profile management
  - Role and permission management (student, instructor, admin)
  - Authentication (integrate with Spring Authorization Server or Keycloak)
  - Central identity provider for all services (issue/validate JWTs)
- **Data:** User profiles, roles, credentials (PostgreSQL)
- **Integration:**
  - Publishes user lifecycle events (e.g., registration, role change) via RabbitMQ
  - Exposes REST APIs (Spring WebFlux)
  - Caches sessions/tokens in Redis

---

### **B. Course Service**
- **Domain:** Courses, Modules, Lessons
- **Responsibilities:**
  - CRUD for courses, modules, lessons
  - Course content authoring and versioning
  - Publishes course lifecycle events (created, updated, deleted) via RabbitMQ
- **Data:** Course structure, content, metadata (PostgreSQL)
- **Integration:**
  - Consumes user events for author/instructor validation
  - Exposes REST APIs (Spring WebFlux)
  - Caches frequently accessed course data in Redis

---

### **C. Enrollment Service**
- **Domain:** Enrollments, Progress Tracking
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Enroll/unenroll users in courses
  - Track lesson/module completion and compute progress
  - Listen to course and user events for consistency
- **Data:** Enrollment records, progress logs (PostgreSQL)
- **Integration:**
  - Consumes course/user events from RabbitMQ
  - Publishes enrollment/progress events (e.g., completion) via RabbitMQ
  - Exposes REST APIs (Spring WebFlux)
  - Caches active enrollments/progress in Redis

---

### **D. Assessment Service**
- **Domain:** Quizzes, Assignments, Grading
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Manage question banks, quiz/assignment definitions
  - Accept and store submissions
  - Auto/manual grading workflows
  - Emit grade-related events (e.g., graded, feedback) via RabbitMQ
- **Data:** Assessments, submissions, grades (PostgreSQL)
- **Integration:**
  - Consumes enrollment/course/user events for validation
  - Publishes assessment/grade events
  - Exposes REST APIs (Spring WebFlux)
  - Caches frequently accessed assessments in Redis

---

### **E. Notification Service**
- **Domain:** Email, Push Notifications
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Subscribe to events from other services (user, course, enrollment, assessment)
  - Fan-out notifications based on user preferences
  - Deduplicate notifications using Redis
- **Data:** Notification templates, user preferences (PostgreSQL)
- **Integration:**
  - Consumes events from RabbitMQ
  - Sends emails/push notifications asynchronously
  - Exposes REST APIs for notification preferences (Spring WebFlux)

---

### **F. Spring Cloud Gateway**
- **Domain:** API Gateway
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Central entry point for all client/API traffic
  - Route requests to appropriate services
  - Validate JWTs, propagate identity headers
  - Enforce security, rate-limiting, and throttling
- **Integration:**
  - Integrates with User Service/Authorization Server for authentication
  - Forwards requests to backend services
  - Centralized logging and monitoring

---

## **Cross-Cutting Concerns**
- **Service Discovery:** Use Kubernetes service discovery or Spring Cloud Discovery
- **Configuration Management:** Centralized config via Spring Cloud Config or Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets
- **Observability:** Distributed tracing, logging, and metrics (e.g., ELK, Prometheus, Grafana)
- **Deployment:** Each service is containerized (Docker), orchestrated via Kubernetes

---

## **Event-Driven Interactions**
- **RabbitMQ** is used for:
  - Publishing and consuming domain events (user, course, enrollment, assessment, notification)
  - Decoupling services and enabling asynchronous workflows

---

## **Caching & Sessions**
- **Redis** is used for:
  - Caching frequently accessed data (courses, enrollments, assessments)
  - Session/token storage for stateless authentication
  - Notification deduplication
